    "description": "I was a visiting student at NKNU during my sophomore winter. There I built my proficiency in Mandarin, got a better understanding of Taiwan’s emergence as a global leader in business, and gained exposure to Taiwan and Asian culture and research. I also took part in field trips to companies in IC design, green technology andIT hardware, which provided a deep insight into the manufacturing ethos of Taiwan. \n 𝐑𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤: Mandarin & Industrial Training",
