  "quote": "One rarely comes across real talents who stand out like Sejal. I had the pleasure of working with Sejal while she was interning at Dell. Sejal was able to fit into the team almost seamlessly, though she joined us straight after college. She was extremely professional with taking up tasks and delivering on time (at times ahead of deadlines). Sejal brings with her a transparent and matured thought process. She is a Machine Learning Ninja and is always on the lookout for tough problem statements. No matter how ambiguous the premise of a challenge be, Sejal has made sure she had the right questions which lead to the best solution. She has also shown very strong traits of being an effective leader. I wish her all the best and as a team member, Sejal earns my highest recommendation"
